                       Welcome to my Final Project Document which contains answers to questions asked in our Final Project Assignment.

The program which I made basically a bus ticket Point Of Sales(POS) system allows the user to Book, Cancel and change his bus reservations. As well as check all the data tables. The program contains many features:-
SoldOut() - Checks if all the tickets are sold out
VerifyPassengerInfo() – To take proper input of user details from a proper name up to every detail.
The program is also not case sensitive so even inputting something like a3 will get the correct seat of A3. As well as that our programs allows the user to stop the program on any wrong or undesired input.  
Goal
My Goal with this project was to make a feature rich POS System which would be able to do most things an actual POS system can do based on our small arrays and to incorporate things that was thought to us though out our CSC101 course.

                                               *Challenges faced throughout the project*
Initially I started following my plan which was quite ambitious for the small-time frame we had for this project. I started by making the initial data structure and planning how the program will be end and how the functions will manipulate our lists. Then according to my plan, I proceeded making each function and additional functions which were needed. Main issues I faced while programming was managing to read and properly change values of each index based on need. A lot of debugging was needed, and I even made functions for few of them like getting specific ticket etc. A huge problem the solution of which I am still not content with is printing the data. .format and  other ways of printing and I am still not content how the output works. For better looking output I took fist and last name separate but still if a very big data is entered the output, we get is not that pleasing to look at. I hope to fix this, but time was limited.
